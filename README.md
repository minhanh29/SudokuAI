# Sudoku AI
*Author*: Minh Anh Nguyen  
This project creates a GUI application that can solve any sudoku puzzles using orginal backtrack and heuristic backtrack algorithms  
## How to use
**Option 1**: directly open the SudokuAI.jar file  
**Option 2**: compile and run the Launcher.java file  
	javac Launcher.java  
	java Launcher  
  
1. Click a cell and press a number to insert it to the cell  
2. Press 0 to delete content of that cell  

## Functionalities
**Radio buttons**  
	*Backtrack*: use orginal backtrack algorithm  
	*Heuristic BT*: heuristic backtrack algorithm  
**Solve**: visualize how the algorithms work to solve the puzzle  
**Unsolve**: unsolve but keep the orginal puzzle  
**Reset**: clean the board, delete all numbers  
**Hint**: reveal an answer of a cell, the order is based on the route of the chosen algorithm
